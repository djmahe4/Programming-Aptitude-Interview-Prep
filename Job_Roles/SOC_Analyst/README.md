# SOC Analyst: Duties, Responsibilities, Career Progression, Interview prep and Roadmap

This document outlines the core duties and responsibilities of a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst, followed by a typical career progression path.

---

## Duties and Responsibilities

- Monitor network traffic, system logs, and security alerts using SIEM, IDS/IPS, and EDR platforms to detect anomalous activity in real time.

- Investigate, contain, and remediate security incidents; document findings and report on incident metrics and root-cause analyses.

- Gather and analyze threat intelligence to identify emerging risks and attack trends; produce actionable intelligence reports for stakeholders.

- Implement, configure, and tune security tools (e.g., Splunk, ELK, QRadar, CrowdStrike, Snort, Suricata, Zeek); ensure they operate optimally.

- Perform vulnerability assessments and penetration tests using tools like Nessus, Qualys, or OpenVAS; coordinate patch management and hardening efforts.

- Develop and maintain security policies, procedures, and playbooks aligned with industry standards and regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).

- Conduct user-awareness training, phishing simulations, and post-incident feedback sessions to bolster organizational security culture.

- Plan and test disaster recovery and business continuity workflows; refine IR drills and tabletop exercises to improve response readiness.
