# CompTIA Network+ Roadmap

## Introduction

This roadmap blends a structured study plan with the proven tactics Gilbert Sanchez shared in his LinkedIn post, where he passed Network+ in three weeks with no IT experience.

---

## Phase 1: Core Content Exposure (Week 1)

- Start with Professor Messer’s [Network+ YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnl_tQe3kvnmeMid0mjF8Le8) at regular speed, taking notes on every objective.  
- Use an ad-free setup (e.g., YouTube Music Premium trial) to maintain focus.  
- Cover overlapping fundamentals thoroughly to build a solid base.

---

## Phase 2: Guided Course & Objective Mapping (Week 1–2)

1. Complete Andrew Ramdayal’s [Network+ Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia_network_plus/) using a 7-day trial, then a monthly subscription.  
2. Download the official [CompTIA Network+ objectives](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/network/#objectives); list all port numbers and acronyms, writing each three times for retention.  
3. Review objectives, flag weak areas, and compile a personalized study guide targeting those gaps.

---

## Phase 3: Practice Exams & Iterative Review (Week 2–3)

- Begin with Jason Dion’s [Practice Exam Set 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-network-n10-009-6-practice-exams-and-pbqs-set-1/) on Udemy; you’ll likely score around 40–50%.  
- Revisit Professor Messer’s playlist at 1.5× speed without notes, focusing on misunderstood topics.  
- Return to Ramdayal’s course for deep-dives on concepts you flagged.

---

## Phase 4: Intensive Exam Prep (Last 3 Days)

- Take three of Dion’s practice exams per day (timed and untimed).  
- Switch to Jason Dion’s [Practice Exam Set 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-network-n10-009-6-practice-exams-and-pbqs-set-2/) to avoid memorization; aim for 70–80%.  
- Document detailed explanations for every incorrect answer.

---

## Phase 5: Final Cram & Exam-Day Preparation (Last 2 Days)

- Day before exam: watch Andrew Ramdayal’s [“100 Network+ Practice Questions”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1_pf-7k2E0) video; pause before answers and note missed questions and reasons.  
- Morning of exam: review Andrew Ramdayal’s [Last Minute Cram Guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4lCBjttgU) and resource list.  
- Purchase a discounted voucher (e.g., via [getcertified4less](https://getcertified4less.com/)) and schedule your test.
