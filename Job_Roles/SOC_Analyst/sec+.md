# CompTIA Security+ Roadmap

## Introduction

This roadmap blends a structured study plan with the proven tactics Gilbert Sanchez shared in his LinkedIn post, where he passed Security+ in three weeks with no prior IT experience.

---

## Phase 1: Core Content Exposure (Week 1)

Before anything else, build or refresh your foundation in networking, OS fundamentals, and basic security concepts.

- Watch Professor Messer’s [Security+ YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnl4QDVqK-hOnoqcSKEIDDuv) at 2× speed to cover all exam objectives quickly.
- Note overlapping Network+ material—this reduces learning time if you already know those topics.

---

## Phase 2: Guided Course & Objective Mapping (Week 1–2)

Deepen your understanding by following a structured course and mapping gaps to official objectives.

1. Complete Andrew Ramdayal’s [Security+ Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia_security_plus/) at 2× speed.  
2. Download the official [CompTIA Security+ objective](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/security/#objectives) breakdown from CompTIA’s website.  
3. Review each objective; list areas you’re weak on or unfamiliar with.  
4. Use ChatGPT (or another AI tutor) to explain each weak point in plain language and compile a personalized study guide.

## Phase 3: Practice Exams & Iterative Review (Week 2–3)

Practice under exam-like conditions and iterate on your knowledge gaps.

- Begin with Andrew Ramdayal’s [practice exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/securitypluspracticeexams/) on Udemy; aim to move from ~70% to 80%.  
- For each incorrect answer, revisit the video lecture or your personal guide and note down detailed explanations.  
- In the final 4–5 days before the exam:
  - Take three timed practice exams per day (first attempts only).  
  - Use Jason Dion’s Practice Exams Sets [1](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-sy0-701-practice-exams/) & [2](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-sy0-701-practice-exams-2nd-edition/) on Udemy; track your scores until you consistently hit 85%+.  
  - Consolidate all explanations for wrong answers into your study guide.

---

## Phase 4: Final Cram & Exam-Day Preparation (Last 2 Days)

Solidify high-yield facts, acronyms, and ports; boost confidence.

- Night before: Watch Andrew Ramdayal’s [“50 Security+ Practice Questions”](https://youtu.be/yPqSLJG8Rt0) video. Pause before answers, write down missed questions and rationales (he missed 8/50).  
- Morning of exam: Review Andrew Ramdayal’s [“Last Minute Cram Guide”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-F8NgCZmkQ) video or Udemy resource list.  
- Obtain a discounted exam voucher (e.g., through a vetted reseller at ~35% off from [phishfinding](https://x.com/phishfinding) ) and schedule your test.
