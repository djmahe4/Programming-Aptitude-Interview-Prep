- Perform social engineering assessments (phishing, pretexting, baiting) to gauge human security resilience.

- Test physical security controls by attempting authorized facility breaches and badge cloning.

- Execute post-exploitation activities: privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence and data exfiltration.

- Analyze detection gaps in SIEM, IDS/IPS and EDR systems; collaborate with Blue Team to improve monitoring logic.

- Document detailed attack narratives, findings, impact assessments and remediation recommendations.

- Stay current on emerging TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures), zero-days and threat actor frameworks.
