# Red Teamer: Duties, Responsibilities, Career Progression and Resources

This document outlines the core duties and responsibilities of a Red Teamer, followed by a typical career progression path.

---

## Duties and Responsibilities

- Conduct reconnaissance and threat modeling to gather intelligence on targets and define objectives.

- Plan and execute covert simulated attacks across networks, applications, endpoints and physical environments.

- Develop, customize and deploy offensive tools and exploits (e.g., Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, custom scripts).

- Perform social engineering assessments (phishing, pretexting, baiting) to gauge human security resilience.

- Test physical security controls by attempting authorized facility breaches and badge cloning.

- Execute post-exploitation activities: privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence and data exfiltration.

- Analyze detection gaps in SIEM, IDS/IPS and EDR systems; collaborate with Blue Team to improve monitoring logic.

- Document detailed attack narratives, findings, impact assessments and remediation recommendations.

- Stay current on emerging TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures), zero-days and threat actor frameworks.

## Career Progression

| Tier | Role                          | Key Focus                                      |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Junior Red Teamer / Pentester | Assist on engagements, basic exploit validation |
| 2    | Red Team Operator             | Lead attack phases, tool development, reporting |
| 3    | Senior Red Teamer             | Design complex scenarios, mentor juniors       |
| 4    | Red Team Lead / Manager       | Oversee operations, client engagement, strategy |
| 5    | Director of Offensive Security / CISO | Define organizational offensive strategy, budget and policy |

## Next Steps and Growth

- Pursue advanced certifications (OSCP, OSEP, CRTO, OSCE) to validate hands-on skills.

- Contribute to open-source tools or publish research to build reputation.

- Present at security conferences (DEF CON, Black Hat, BSides) and join red-team communities.

- Cross-train in blue-team and purple-team disciplines to enhance holistic security understanding.
